# BIOS6623Class

# This repository belongs to Rachel Johnson. In the test repository, myrepo, the README.md document was edited in Notepad, but in this repository, bios6623-johnsra3, it is being edited in RStudio as an R Markdown document. I pulled from GitHub, edited locally in RStudio, saved the document, committed the changes in GitKraken, and then finally pushed the changes back to GitHub. 


This folder contains the project materials for BIOS6623 minus datasets.  The datasets are not in this repository because you never know when data contains sensitive information. So, we want to minimize the risk that data could be accidentally shared. We have created folder templates for all projects. These provide one way of organizing work in an common framework.

For this class, the datasets can be found on CANVAS.
